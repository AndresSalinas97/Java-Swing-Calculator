# Java Swing MVC Calculator

**Lab Assignment no. 2 for Interactive Systems course.**

A simple GUI based calculator made with Java Swing following the MVC pattern.

It works like a typical calculator in the sense that you can concatenate operations (without pressing the equal button in every step).

Functionality and layout was inspired by the iPhone iOS 13 Calculator App.
